# vue3-chrome-extension-demo


##  A demo that can be used to develop a Chrome plugin using Vue3+ Vite6 and quickly build it.
  

# Get started 

1. clone
```
 git clone https://github.com/ueiheng/vue3-chrome-extension-demo.git
```

2. install
```
 npm i
```

3. build
```
npm run build
```

4. Load the unzipped extension in your browser.

5. All you need to do is use the `npm run build` command every time you finish writing your code, and the browser plugin will automatically reload. 

6. If you want to automate packaging after you've written code, maybe `vite-plugin-watch` can help you.

  üöÄ you can easily use `http://localhost:5173/` to see vue page, Debugging just like we would with a Vue project.


  After confirmation, package to see the effect of the plug-in
